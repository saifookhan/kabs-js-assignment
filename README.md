# Kabs Javascript Assignment

## Task

Implement an application to manage working tasks.

User Stories
• As a user I can create tasks, so that all tasks for a project can be tracked.
– Acceptance Criteria:
– A task must have a title
– A Task must have a long description
– A Task must have the status “ToDo”
• As a user I can see a list of all tasks grouped by it’s status, so that everybody can get a general overview of the project.
• As a user I can change the status of a Task, so that the progress of the project can be tracked.
– Acceptance Criteria:
– Only the following status transitions are allowed, see State transitions
• As a user I can assign a task to another user, so that the responsibility of a task can be visualized.

## To start the project

First clone. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

## What went wrong?

- I started off to use AntDesign table and that took a lot of time to create a custom row for me.
- Hence I decided to come back to material UI which I am more familiar with.
- I might have overdone the assignment but I thought since I am already late, lets put proper effort.
- Second, some other non-task related problems occurred.

### Possible Improvements

- Better UI handling

### Extras

- Delete functionality

### Known Bugs

- Labels and description both not mandatory

### Learnings

- Choose your weapons wisely for the weapons and plan ahead.
