# Kabs Javascript Assignment

## To start the project

First clone. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

## What went wrong?

- I started off to use AntDesign table and that took a lot of time to create a custom row for me.
- Hence I decided to come back to material UI which I am more familiar with.
- I might have overdone the assignment but I thought since I am already late, lets put proper effort.
- Second, some other non-task related problems occurred.

### Possible Improvements

- Better UI handling

### Extras

- Delete functionality

### Known Bugs

- Labels and description both not mandatory

### Learnings

- Choose your weapons wisely for the weapons and plan ahead.
